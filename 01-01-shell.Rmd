## Introduction

Computers can do four things:

* run programs
* store data
* communicate with each other
* interact with us

You are probably used to interacting with computers using a *graphical user 
interface* or *GUI*. Today we are going to use a *command-line interface*. or
*CLI*. When we use a CLI we type commands and the computer shows us the output.
The program we use to do this is called a *command shell*, in particular we
use the *bash* shell. This can be the most convenient way to interact with
remote machines and supercomputers.

### The scenario

The scenario we use in the Shell lesson is based around Nelle Nemo, a marine
biologist. She has many samples and needs to:

1. Run each sample on a machine
2. Calculate statistics usig a program called `goostat`
3. Compare the statistics using a program called `goodiff`
4. Write up the results

This is going to take a long time! In this lesson we are going to explore how
we can use the shell to make Nelle's work easier.
