# Shell

We need to download some files for this lesson:

1. Download `shell-novice-data.zip` from
   [https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-novice-data.zip](download)
   and move the file to your Desktop.
2. Unzip/extract the file^[ask your instructor if you need help with this step].
   You should end up with a new folder called `data-shell` on your `Desktop`.
3. Open a terminal and type:

```{bash}
cd
```

In the lesson, you will find out how to access the data in this folder.

rm -rf data-shell
unzip shell-novice-data.zip
```
